## How to Use

Once installed, the Aggressive Mobs mod will work automatically. Mobs that were previously peaceful or neutral (such as cows, sheep, pigs, llamas, etc.) will now attack the player on sight.

There are no special commands or configurations needed to activate the mod. Simply explore the world and be prepared for the new hostile behavior of the fauna!

Have fun (and try to survive)!
